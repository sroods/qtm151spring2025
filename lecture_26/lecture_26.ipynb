    "- Emphasized \"chaining\" of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Specialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is great at math, logic, and data analysis.\n",
    "- SQL is great at updating, managing and retrieving datasets, <br>\n",
    "particularly at a corporate level.\n",
    "- Integrations across languages is straightforward!\n",

    "(2) Extensibility\n",
